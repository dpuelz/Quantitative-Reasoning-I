# Units, Dimension, and Scale 
Goals:

-   Review notions of unit, dimension, and scale

-   Explore arsenic case study

-   Program in Python

# Zaslow Appendix 5 (review/learn)

-   5.1: Units

-   5.2: Scientific notation

-   5.3: Scientific notation under operations

# Some practical instances (estimate value with appropriate unit) 

-   US Gross Domestic Product

-   Avagadro's number

-   number of calculations a supercomputer performs in a day

-   chance of winning this week's Powerball jackpot

-   charge on an electron

-   number of cells in a liver

# Intensive vs. extensive properties

The physical properties of a system can be classified into two categories:

-   __Extensive properties__ depend on the mass of a system.

-   __Intensive properties__ are independent of the mass of a system.

Examples of each?

See https://sciencenotes.org/intensive-extensive-properties/ for more on this.

# Zaslow Ch. 4 - Should I worry about arsenic (As) in rice?
\pause
Do you you have a prior opinion?

\pause
What are the possible responses?

\pause
What would it take for you to favor a particular respone?

\pause
What are the key subquestions to answer?

\pause
-   How much As do I ingest associated with rice consumption?

\pause
-   Is that quantity of As enough to worry about?

# Example: ppm 
Quantities of As in water are are measured in _parts per million_, or _ppm_.
\pause

\begin{center}
ppm = (mass of solute)/(mass of solution)
\end{center}

\pause
Note: "ppm" is technically unitless; i.e.,

\begin{center}
1 ppm = 1 mg/kg
\end{center}

\pause
For water solution with neglible solute mass,

\begin{center}
ppm = 1 mg/L
\end{center}

# Python programming
Two programs today:

- Simple program that triples and input and generates formatted output.

- Documented program that performs conversion similar to assigned problem.
