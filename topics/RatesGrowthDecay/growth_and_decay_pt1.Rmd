# Growth and Decay (Part 1) 
Goals:

-   Be familiar with applications of the exponential function.

-   Convert other exponential bases to the natural base.

-   Apply the exponential function to problem-solving in growth and decay settings.


# AI says...
Ask an online AI tool, "What is the most important function in mathematics?"  Odds are you'll get something like this:

\pause

\textit{If we were to pinpoint a single function that stands out due to its widespread application and importance, \textbf{many would argue for the exponential function},}
\begin{center}
$y = e^x$, 
\end{center}

\textit{where $e \approx 2.718$.}

Why?

# AI continues...
- This function is crucial in various fields, including calculus, complex analysis, and differential equations.

- The exponential function is particularly significant because it models growth and decay processes, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and interest calculations in finance. 

- Its inverse, the natural logarithm function ($\ln(x)$), is equally important for solving equations involving exponentials.


# Applications too vast to number
The exponential function has numerous important applications across various fields:

- Biology: Population Growth, Spread of Diseases, Carbon Dating

- Physics: Radioactive Decay, Newton's Law of Cooling

- Finance: Compound Interest

- Engineering: Current in Electrical Circuits, Integral Transforms

- Computer Science : Algorithm Analysis, Data Structures

- Chemistry:  Reaction Rates

- Probability:  Time Between Events, Reliability, Queueing Theory, Normal Distribution and CLT
