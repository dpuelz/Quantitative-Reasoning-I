Data Ink and Graphical Redesign
When designing a graph, focusing on the data-relevant information is essential.

The main goal is to reason about quantitative information.   Main Principle: “Show The Data”.

Data Ink and Graphical Redesign
Bilateral symmetry creates redundancy…. ??
In some cases, it may be a good idea to maintain symmetry to avoid confusion. 


Examples:  




 


# Slide 10

![Slide 10 Image](theory_figs/fig_6.png)

![Slide 10 Image](theory_figs/fig_5.png)

Data Ink and Graphical Redesign
A general principle is to “Erase Redundant Data-Ink”. 

However, redundancy is sometimes necessary to give a better perspective on patterns and cycles.  

Example:  Ocean currents around the world. 




 
One time around the world. 
One and two third times around the world. 

# Slide 11

![Slide 11 Image](theory_figs/fig_5.png)

![Slide 11 Image](theory_figs/fig_4.png)

Data Ink and Graphical Redesign
It is a good idea to edit and redesign to minimize redundant, non-data information.  




 
Example: 


# Slide 12

Conclusion



 
Principles to remember: 


Show data-related information

Maximize data-ink ratio

Erase non-relevant data

![Slide 17 Image](theory_figs/fig_3.png)

Data Ink Maximization and Graphical Design
It is allowed to apply the principles of graphical design to generate NEW designs.

The main idea is to focus on what matters and to eliminate what is irrelevant. 

That may lead to new designs.  








 




 
Typical box plot
It can be simplified by eliminating lines:

# Slide 23

![Slide 23 Image](theory_figs/fig_5.png)

![Slide 23 Image](theory_figs/fig_3.png)

Data Ink Maximization and Graphical Design
A classic example is that of the bivariate scatter plot.  
The principles of graphical design suggest the following:
Frame lines should extend only along the data range. 
A Range Frame. Data-ink ratio increases. 

# Slide 24

Data Ink Maximization and Graphical Design
Look at this graph showing marginal distributions 
(an excellent graphic design): 


                               Signals from pulsars

# Slide 26

Conclusions
Graphical design eliminates unnecessary information. 

It adds new ideas to maximize efficiency (leading to new designs). 

Data-Ink ratio should be close to 1.0

Efficiency should be gained in communication and production.

Consider that some designs may be hard to understand. 
     Use your criteria to decide how to present a graph according to the audience.

# Slide 28

Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design








 




 
Graphical design should look for elegance and simplicity.

This is particularly important when the data is complex. 

Guidelines:
Combine words, numbers and graph together
Provide a story behind the data. 
The design should avoid irrelevant information and be done professionally.

Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design








 




 
It is a good idea to combine graphical elements.

Example: Words and Table:


Tables: 

Ideal for small datasets. 
To be preferred to pie charts.

An example of a combination 
of words and graphs: 


Predictions above expectation    
Predictions below expectation    

# Slide 31

Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design








 




 
Words and pictures BELONG together. 

Words add helpful information, giving meaning 
to the graph elements.  


A manuscript of Leonardo DaVinci    
Tables and graphics should run into the text.

Avoid the typical “see Figure 1 for an example…”.   



# Slide 32

Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design








 




 
Friendly Graphs: 

Words are clear and informative (avoid abbreviations).

Words should be read left to right (not vertically).

Avoid legends or elaborated colors. Put clear labels.  

Graph is attractive. 

Use a few colors (clearly distinguishable). 

Type clearly and precisely (avoid all capitals).

There must be a sense of balance and proportion:

Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design








 




 
Lines can be shown with different weights. 
The heavier line should correspond to the actual measurement. 

# Slide 35

![Slide 35 Image](theory_figs/fig_7.png)

![Slide 35 Image](theory_figs/fig_4.png)

Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design








 




 
Graphs should tend toward the horizontal direction (wider not longer). 
This is because humans process information in the horizontal direction. 
An ideal example is the Golden Rectangle.  

# Slide 36

![Slide 36 Image](theory_figs/fig_4.png)

Labeling should also tend toward the horizontal line.
