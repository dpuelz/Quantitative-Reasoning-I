# Data Ink and Graphical Redesign
- When designing a graph, focusing on the data-relevant information is essential.
\pause
- Main Goal: Reason about quantitative information. 
\pause
- Main Principle: Show the data.

# Conclusion

Principles to remember: 

- Show data-related information

- Maximize data-ink ratio

- Erase non-relevant data

- Erase redundancies

- Practice the idea of editing and revisiting.

# Conclusions
- Graphical design eliminates unnecessary information. 

- It adds new ideas to maximize efficiency (leading to new designs). 

- Data-Ink ratio should be close to 1.

- Efficiency should be gained in communication and production.

- Consider that some designs may be hard to understand. 

- Use your criteria to decide how to present a graph according to the audience. 

# Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design
Graphical design should look for elegance and simplicity.

This is particularly important when the data are complex.  

Guidelines:

- Combine words, numbers and graph together.

- Provide a story behind the data. 

- The design should avoid irrelevant information and be done professionally. 

# Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design

Combine graphical elements when appropriate.

Tables are:

- ideal for small datasets. 

- preferable to pie charts.

# Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design
Friendly Graphs: 

- Words are clear and informative (avoid abbreviations).

- Words should be read left to right (not vertically).

- Avoid legends or elaborated colors. Put clear labels.  

- Graph is attractive. 

- Use a few colors (clearly distinguishable). 

- Type clearly and precisely (avoid all capitals). 


# Aesthetics and Technique in Data Graphical Design
There should be a sense of balance and proportion.

\begin{flushleft}
Graphs should tend toward the horizontal direction (wider not longer), because humans process information in the horizontal direction.

# Epilogue
"What is to be sought in designs for the display of quantitative information is the clear portrayal of complexity.  Not the complication of the simple; rather the task of the designer is to give visual access to the subtle and the difficult -- that is,
\begin{center}
  the revelation of the complex.
