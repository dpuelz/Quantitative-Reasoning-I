Graphical Excellence
Excellence is achieved when complex ideas are expressed with


Clarity



Precision



Efficiency













Show the data clearly.

Aim to have a quick understanding of the data trend.

Do not distort the data.

Facilitate comparisons.

Compress data in small spaces.

Show data at different scales.

<!-- Data Maps -->
<!-- Shortcomings: -->

<!-- The population of each county -->

<!-- Changes across counties are  -->
<!-- abrupt (not smooth).  -->

<!-- How reliable is the data? -->
<!-- (the diagnosis may be biased).  -->
















<!-- # Slide 13 -->

<!-- Data Maps -->
<!-- Modern data maps of  -->
<!-- the Universe.   -->

<!-- Time Series -->
<!-- This is the most frequent type of graph design.  -->

<!-- The x-axis contains time in one of many possible units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years, etc.). -->

<!-- Time series can focus on the graphical evolution of body parts.   -->













<!-- # Slide 21 -->

<!-- ![Slide 21 Image](excellence_figs/fig_20.png) -->

<!-- Time Series -->
<!-- We have not talked about causation. Time series graphs do not necessarily convey causal explanations. -->
<!-- This can be achieved by adding more variables to the graph.   -->

<!-- But there are exceptions to simple graphs conveying causal information:   -->












<!-- Outgoing mail (millions) by incumbent representatives. -->

<!-- Representatives use the privilege of free mail to send many letters  -->
<!-- during re-election campaigns.  -->

<!-- # Slide 23 -->

<!-- ![Slide 23 Image](excellence_figs/fig_21.png) -->

<!-- Space-Time Narrative Designs -->
<!-- Time-series graphs can be enhanced by adding spatial dimensions. -->

<!-- This adds multivariate complexity that should be easy to visualize and interpret. -->

<!-- Example: Life-cycle of the Japanese beetle:  -->












<!-- # Slide 24 -->

<!-- ![Slide 24 Image](excellence_figs/fig_22.png) -->

<!-- Space-Time Narrative Designs -->
<!-- An all-time favorite graph shows the fate of Napoleons army in Russia (1812-1813). See the reference book for an explanation.   -->

<!-- # Slide 27 -->

<!-- ![Slide 27 Image](excellence_figs/fig_24.png) -->

<!-- Relational Graphics -->
<!-- It is similar to previous graphs, but the dimensions can differ from spatial coordinates. -->
<!-- The word relational refers to the dependence of two variables (any variables). -->

<!-- Example:    Each circle refers to a country.  -->













<!-- The size of the circle correlates  -->
<!-- with the area of the country. -->

<!-- The line on the left is the  -->
<!-- population in millions -->

<!-- The line on the right is the -->
<!-- taxes collected in millions -->
<!-- of pounds.   -->







<!-- What is important -->
<!-- is the sign of the slope -->
<!-- for every connecting line.    -->








<!-- # Slide 28 -->

<!-- ![Slide 28 Image](excellence_figs/fig_25.png) -->

<!-- Relational Graphics -->
<!-- Relational graphs are the greatest of graphical designs. -->
<!-- They help look for causal information.   -->













<!-- The relationship of lung cancer and smoking.     -->








<!-- # Slide 29 -->

<!-- ![Slide 29 Image](excellence_figs/fig_26.png) -->

<!-- Relational Graphics -->
<!-- Relational graphs are the greatest of graphical designs. -->
<!-- They help look for causal information.   -->













<!-- Is there a connection between inflation and unemployment? -->

<!-- Apparently NOT!     -->








<!-- # Slide 30 -->

<!-- ![Slide 30 Image](excellence_figs/fig_27.png) -->

<!-- Relational Graphics -->
<!-- Graphs can be very informative. -->

<!-- Data points can convey a lot of information. -->

<!-- History -->

<!-- Great inventors of modern graphical design.  -->











<!-- William Playfair -->
<!-- Scottish political economist  -->
<!-- 1759-1823 -->
<!-- (published the first time series economic data). -->












<!-- He created many types of charts. -->
<!-- A popular one is the bar chart.  -->












<!-- He worked as a millwright, engineer, draftsman,  -->
<!-- accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer, and journalist.  (extracted from Wikipedia).  -->

<!-- # Slide 37 -->

<!-- ![Slide 37 Image](excellence_figs/fig_34.png) -->

<!-- History -->

<!-- William Playfair showed in this graph prices, wages, and reigns of the British monarchy.  -->
<!-- The novelty lies in combining all that information in one graph.    -->












<!-- # Slide 38 -->

<!-- ![Slide 38 Image](excellence_figs/fig_35.png) -->

<!-- Summary - Conclusions -->

<!-- Good graphs succinctly convey substantial information. -->

<!-- Coming up with a good design is challenging.  -->

<!-- Ideas must be conveyed with clarity, precision, and efficiency.  -->
