  - Python is a versatile, high-level programming language.
  - Used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.
  
- **Why Python?**
  - Easy to learn and read.
  - Extensive community and resources.
  - Powerful libraries for various fields: science, art, business, and more.

## Value-prop for STEM

- **Data Science & Machine Learning**:
  - Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, SciPy.
  - Used for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and building models.
- **Engineering & Simulations**:
  - Used in simulations, optimization, and algorithmic computations.

## Value-prop for Humanities?

Yes!

- **Text Analysis & Digital Humanities**:
  - Libraries: NLTK, spaCy for natural language processing.
  - Analyze large amounts of text for sentiment, themes, and word frequencies.
  
  
- **Creative Arts & Media**:
  - Python is used in image processing, media production, and art installations.
  - Libraries like PIL (Pillow) and Pygame.

## Basic Python Syntax (Quick Overview)

- **Variables & Types**:

  ```python
  x = 10  # Integer
  name = "Alice"  # String
  is_student = True  # Boolean
  ```

- **Functions**:

  ```python
  def greet():
      print("Hello, world!")
  ```

- **Loops & Conditionals**:

  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      if i % 2 == 0:
          print(i, "is even")
  ```

## Installing Python

- **Step 1: Download Python**:
  - Go to [python.org](https://python.org).
  - Click "Downloads" and select your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

- **Step 2: Install Python**:
  - Follow installation instructions on screen.
  - Ensure you check the box to "Add Python to PATH."

## Using Python

- **Step 1: Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**:
  - Type `python` or `python3` to start the Python interpreter.

- **Step 2: Running Scripts**:
  - Create a `.py` file using a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text, Notepad++).
  - Run the script in the terminal: `python script_name.py`.

- **Step 3: Using Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - Install with `pip install notebook`.
  - Start a notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
